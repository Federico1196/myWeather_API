This HTTP server uses Node.js and some HTML and CSS, to allow a selection between some cities in a drop-down menu:

![weatherPic](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/446c867c-38b7-4c2d-be3a-303865112f8b)

After selecting and hitting submit, the program will automatically generate the current weather of that selected city. The weather information is given to the Image API and it will show the image related to the current weather obtained with the Weather API, i.e. its sunny, will present a sunny image.
